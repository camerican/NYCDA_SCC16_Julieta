		<p>Hello! My name is Julieta Hang but my friends call me Juli. I’m Argentinean and I’ve recently moved to San Francisco to pursue a Master in International Marketing. Let me tell you: I am IN LOVE with the city!</p>

		<p>If I had to describe myself I’d say: I am an amateur dancer who loves everything related to it. I have taken jazz and contemporary classes for 10 years now, and I have taken classes in Argentina, France and USA. I also enjoy going to the theater to see any type of dance performance.</p>

		<p>And at the same time, regarding my professional background, I am a 100% marketing girl. I have 5 years of experience in the business and I developed a huge love for this art (yes, IT IS an ART). As it evolves and it becomes more numerical, measurable and statistical it continues to have the aura of creativity and magic of telling a story that attract me in the first place. This magic is what first moved me to write this blog. The resemblances between my two passions are the main topic of this blog.</p>
