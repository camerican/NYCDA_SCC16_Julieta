<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters. </p>
<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
<p> CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
	<ul class="historic events"> 
	<li>the Cold War </li>
	<li>the civil-rights movement</li> 
	<li>the growth of the international drug trade </li>
	</ul>
	</*EDITOR'S NOTE: * Be sure to turn the bulleted historic events into a list. * Bold Porter Goss's name on first reference * Turn this note into a comment>
